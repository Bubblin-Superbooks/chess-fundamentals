The proper way was to play K - Q 3. If then R - Q Kt 5, R é R; B é R, Kt - Q 5; followed by P - Q Kt 4; and White would have an exceedingly difficult game to draw on account of the dominating position of the Knight at {168}Q 5 in conjunction with the extra Pawn on the Queen's side and the awkward position of White's King.
