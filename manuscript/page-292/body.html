<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><ol><li>K - Kt 2 !</li></ol><p><em>This</em> is the move which I had not considered. I thought that Rubinstein would have to play B - Kt 2, when I had in mind the following winning combination: 16 B - Kt 2, Kt - K 4 ! 17 Kt - B 4 (if R - B 1, Q é R !! Q é Q, B é P ch wins), Kt - Kt 5; 18 P - K R 3 (if Kt - R 3, B é P ch wins the exchange), Kt é P; 19 R é Kt, B é R ch; 20 K é B, P - K Kt 4, and Black should win. It is curious that this combination has been overlooked. It has been taken for granted that I did not see the 17th move Q - B 1.</p><ol><li>........</li></ol><p>Q R - Q 1</p><p>After White's last move there was nothing for me to do but submit to the inevitable.</p></ol></div> </div>
