WINNING BY INDIRECT ATTACK</p><p>We have so far given positions where the attacks were of a violent nature and directed against the King's position. Very often, however, in the middle-game attacks are made against a position or against pieces, or even Pawns.</p><p><em>The winning of a Pawn among good players of even strength often means the winning of the game.</em></p><p>Hence the study of such positions is of great importance.
