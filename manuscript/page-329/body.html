<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>B - Kt 2</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Played against my better judgment. The right move of course was B é B. Dr. Lasker gives the following variation: 13...B é B; 14 R é B, P - B 4; 15 Q R - Q 1, B - Kt 2; 16 R - B 2, Q R - Q 1; 17 R é R, R é R; 18 R - Q 2, R é R; 19 Kt é R, and he claims that White has the best of it. But, as Niemzovitch pointed out immediately after the game, 16...Q R - Q 1 given in Dr. Lasker's variation, is not the best. If 16...Q R - B 1 ! then White will have great difficulty in drawing the game, {185}since there is no good way to stop Black from playing Kt - B 3, followed by Kt - K 4, threatening Kt - B 5. And should White attempt to meet this manœuvre by withdrawing the Kt at Kt 3; then the Black Knight can go to Q 5, and the White Pawn at K 4 will be the object of the attack. Taking Dr. Lasker's variation, however, whatever advantage there might be disappears at once if Black plays 19...Kt - B 3, threatening Kt - Kt 5</p></div> </div>
