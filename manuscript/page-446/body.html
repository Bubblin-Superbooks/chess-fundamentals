The opening is over and the middle-game begins. White, as is generally the case, has {240}obtained the centre. Black, on the other hand, is entrenched in his first three ranks, and if given time will post his Q R at Q B 1 and his Knight at K B 3, and finally play P - Q B 4, in order to break up White's centre and give full action to the Black Bishop posted at Q Kt 2. In this game White attempts to anticipate that plan by initiating an advance on the centre, which, when carefully analysed, is truly an attack against Black's K P.</p></ol></div> </div>
