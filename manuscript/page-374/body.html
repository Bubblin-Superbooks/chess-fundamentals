It will consist in bringing my Bishop around to B 3. Then I shall try to paralyse White's attack against my King by playing P - K R 3, and also prevent White from ever playing P - K Kt 5. Once my King is safe from attack I shall begin to advance my Queen's side Pawns, where there are four to three; and that advantage, coupled with the enormous attacking power of my Bishop at B 3, will at least assure me an even chance of success.</p><ol><li>Q - B 3</li></ol><p>B - K 2</p><ol><li>Q R - K 2</li></ol><p>B - B 3</p></ol></div> </div>
