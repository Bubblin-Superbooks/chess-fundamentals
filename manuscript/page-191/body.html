It is evident to Black that White wants to bring his King to Q Kt 3 to support his two weak isolated Pawns, and thus to free his Rooks. Black, therefore, makes a plan to shift the attack to the King's side at the proper time, in order to obtain some advantage from the greater mobility of his Rooks.</p><ol><li>R - Q 1</li></ol><p>R (Q 4) - Q R 4</p></div> </div>
