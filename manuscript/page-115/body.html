ATTACKING WITH KNIGHTS AS A PROMINENT FORCE</p><p>![Chess position](images/Fig51.jpg "Chess position" "")</p><h5>Example 46.—White Is Two Pawns Behind. He Must Therefore Press On His Attack. The Game Continues:</h5><ol><li>Kt (B 5) é Kt P</li></ol><p>Kt - B 4</p><p>Evidently an error which made the winning easier for White, as he simply took the Rook with the Knight and kept up the attack. Black should have played: 1 ... Kt é Kt. Then would have followed: 2 Kt - B 6 ch, K - Kt 3; 3 Kt é B, P - B 3 (best); 4 P - K 5, K - B 2; 5 Kt é P, R - K 2; 6 Kt - K 4, and Black should lose.-</p></div> </div>
