He can only free it by sacrificing one Pawn, and possibly not even then. At least it would lose time besides the Pawn. Black now devotes all his energy to the Queen's side, and, having practically a Bishop more, the result cannot be in doubt. The rest of the game is given, so that the student may see how simple it is to win such a game. {99}</p><ol><li>K - Kt 2</li></ol><p>P - Q R 4</p><ol><li>P - Q R 4</li></ol></div> </div>
