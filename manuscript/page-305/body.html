Black's weak point is unquestionably the Pawn at K 4, which he is compelled to defend with the King. The text move aims at doubling the Rooks, with the ultimate object of placing one of them at Q 6, supported by a Pawn at Q B 5, Black could only stop this by playing P - B 4 which would create a "hole" at Q 5; or by playing P - Kt 3, which would tie the Black Queen to the defence of the Q B P as well as the K P, which she already defends. Black, however, can meet all this by offering the exchange of Rooks, which destroys White's plans. For this reason P - K R 4 appears the proper way to carry on</p></div> </div>
