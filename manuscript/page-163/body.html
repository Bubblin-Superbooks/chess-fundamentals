Then, if possible, the K Kt is linked with the other Kt by placing it at either K R 4, K Kt 3, or K 3 as the occasion demands. The White King sometimes remains at Kt 1, and other times it is placed at K Kt 2, but mostly at K R 1. Finally, in most cases comes P - K B 4, and then the real attack begins. Sometimes it is a direct assault against the King,-  and at other times it comes simply to finessing for positional advantage in the end-game, after most of the pieces have been exchanged.-</p><ol><li>........</li></ol><p>P - K R 3</p><ol><li>B - R 4</li></ol><p>P - B 4</p><p>{97}</p></div> </div>
