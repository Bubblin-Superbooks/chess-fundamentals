I was, however, still looking for the "grand combination," and thought that the Pawn I would later on have at Q 6 would win the game. Black deserves great credit for the way in which he conducted this exceedingly difficult {180}defence. He could easily have gone wrong any number of times, but from move 22 onwards he always played the best move.</p><ol><li>........</li></ol><p>P - K 4 !</p><ol><li>Q - Kt 1</li></ol><p>P - K 5</p><ol><li>P é Kt</li></ol><p>P é R</p></ol></div> </div>
