The text move, however, only helps White; therefore Black had nothing better than to hold tight and wait. R - K 4 would not help much, as White would simply answer R - B 8, R - K 1; R (Kt 5) Ã© R, and whichever Rook Black took, White would have an easy game. (The student should carefully study these variations.)</p></ol></div> </div>
