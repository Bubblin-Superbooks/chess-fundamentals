The reason is that while I knew the game to be lost, I was hoping for the following variation, which Chajes came very near playing: 51 Q é P ch, K - R 2; 52 Q - R 5, R é P; 53 B - Kt 5 ch, K - Kt 2; 54 B é R ch, K é B; and while White has a won game it is by no means easy. If the reader does not believe it, let him take the White pieces against a master and see what happens. My opponent, who decided to take no chances, played 51 B - Kt 7, and finally won as shown below.</p><ol><li>B - Kt 7</li></ol><p>P - Kt 6</p></ol></div> </div>
