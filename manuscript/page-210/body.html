Black sees that he can take a Pawn without any danger, and does not stop to think whether there is anything better. R - B 7 ch was the right move. If then K - Kt 3, R é P. If instead White played K - K 4, then R - K 4 ch followed by R é R P.</p><ol><li>R - Q 1</li></ol><p>R - R 5 ch</p><p>Mistake number two, and this time such a serious one as to almost lose the game. The proper move was to play P - B 4 in order to break up White's Pawns and at the same time make room for the Black King, which is actually in danger, as will soon be seen.</p></ol></div> </div>
