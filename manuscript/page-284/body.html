If I had to play this position nowadays I would simply play 13...R - K 1. Then after 14 Q é P, Q é Q would follow, and I believe that Black would regain the Pawn. If, instead, White played 14 P é P then B - Kt 5 would give Black an excellent game.</p><ol><li>P - R 5</li></ol><p>B - Kt 2</p><ol><li>O - O</li></ol><p>Q - B 2</p><ol><li>K R - Kt 1</li></ol><p>Kt - Q 2</p><p>{162}</p></div> </div>
