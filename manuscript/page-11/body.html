<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>In chess the tactics may change but the strategic fundamental principles are always the same, so that <em>Chess Fundamentals</em> is as good now as it was thirteen years ago. It will be as good a hundred years from now; as long in fact as the laws and rules of the game remain what they are at present. The reader may therefore go over the contents of the book with the assurance that there is in it everything he needs, and that there is nothing to be added and nothing to be changed. <em>Chess Fundamentals</em> was the one standard work of its kind thirteen years ago and the author firmly believes that it is the one standard work of its kind now.</p><p>J.
