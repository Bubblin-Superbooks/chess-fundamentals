Incidentally, this ending will demonstrate the great power of the Bishop. White's best chance was to take a draw at once, thus. 21 Kt - K 7 ch K - B 1; 22 R - B 7 R - K 1 (not B é P; because P - B 3 would give White the best of it); 23 R é B (best; not Kt - Kt 6 ch, because of B P é Kt; followed by R é K P), R é Kt; 24 R - Kt 8 ch, R - K 1; 25 R é R ch, K é R, and with proper play White will draw.</p><p>It is curious that, although a Pawn ahead, White is the one who is always in danger. It is only now, after seeing this analysis, that the value of Black's 18th move Q - K 4 can be fully appreciated.</p><ol><li>........</li></ol></div> </div>
