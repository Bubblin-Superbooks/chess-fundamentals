Besides, he wants to be ready to play P - K 5. At present White cannot with safety play R é K P, but he will soon prepare the way for it. Then, by giving up a Rook for a Bishop and a Pawn, he will completely upset Black's attack and come out a Pawn ahead. It is on this basis that White's whole defensive manœuvre is founded.</p></ol></div> </div>
