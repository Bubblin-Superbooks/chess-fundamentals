He should have played his Rook to Kt 3 on the 27th move. Black now should have played P - Kt 4 ch. After missing this chance White has it all his own way, and finishes the game most accurately, and Black becomes more {188}helpless with each move. The game needs no further comment, excepting that my play throughout was of an altogether irresolute character. When a plan is made, it must be carried out if at all possible. Regarding the play of White, I consider his 10th and 12th moves were very weak; he played well after that up to the 27th move, which was bad, as well as his 28th move. The rest of his play was good, probably perfect.</p></ol></div> </div>
