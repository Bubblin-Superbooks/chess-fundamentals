Again the same case.

If now White advances the Pawn, the Black King gets in front of it and White must either give up the Pawn or play K - K 6, and a stale mate results. If instead of advancing the Pawn White withdraws his King, Black brings his King up to the Pawn and, when forced to go back, he moves to K <em>in front</em> of the Pawn ready to come up again or to move in front of the White King, as before, should the latter advance.</p></div> </div>
