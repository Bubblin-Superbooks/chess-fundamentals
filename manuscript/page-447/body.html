It was carelessness on my part, but Marshall believed differently, otherwise he would not have played this variation, since, had he analysed this move, he would, I think, have realised that Black would obtain an excellent game. Black now threatens not only B P é P; but also Kt é P; followed by B P é P. The position is very interesting and full of possibilities.</p><p>![Chess position](images/Fig146.jpg "Chess position" "")</p><p>{241}</p><ol><li>P é K P</li></ol><p>Kt é P (K 3)</p></ol></div> </div>
