Since then there have appeared at different times a number of articles dealing with the so-called Hypermodern Theory. Those who have read the articles may well have thought that something new, of vital importance, had been discovered. The fact is that the Hypermodern Theory is merely the application, during the opening stages generally, of the same old principles through the medium of somewhat new tactics. There has been no change in the fundamentals. The change has been only a change of form, and not always for the best at that.</p>",
  "page-11": "<p>In chess the tactics may change but the strategic fundamental principles are always the same, so that <em>Chess Fundamentals</em> is as good now as it was thirteen years ago. It will be as good a hundred years from now; as long in fact as the laws and rules of the game remain what they are at present. The reader may therefore go over the contents of the book with the assurance that there is in it everything he needs, and that there is nothing to be added and nothing to be changed. <em>Chess Fundamentals</em> was the one standard work of its kind thirteen years ago and the author firmly believes that it is the one standard work of its kind now.</p><p>J.

SOME SIMPLE MATES</p><h5>Example 1.—The Ending Rook And King Against King.</h5><p><em>The principle is to drive the opposing King to the last line on any side of the board</em>.</p><p>![Chess position](images/Fig1.jpg \"Chess position\" \"\")</p>",

The general principle for a beginner to follow is to</p><p><em>keep his King as much as possible on the same rank, or, as in this case, file, as the opposing King.</em></p><p>When, in this case, the King has been brought to the sixth rank, it is better to place it, not on the same file, but on the one next to it towards the centre.</p><p>2...K - B 1; 3 K - B 3, K - K 1; 4 K - K 4, K - Q 1; 5 K - Q 5, K - B 1; 6 K - Q 6.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Not K - B 6, because then the Black King will go back to Q 1 and it will take much longer to mate.

On move 5 Black could have played K - K 1, and, according to principle, White would have continued 6 K - Q 6, K - B 1 (the Black King will ultimately be forced to move in front of the White King and be mated by R - R 8); 7 K - K 6, K - Kt 1; 8 K - B 6, K - R 1; 9 K - Kt 6, K - Kt 1; 10 R - R 8 mate. {5}</p><h5>Example 2.</h5><p>![Chess position](images/Fig2.jpg \"Chess position\" \"\")</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Since the Black King is in the centre of the board, the best way to proceed is to advance your own King thus: 1 K - K 2, K - Q 4; 2 K - K 3.

Now {6}White mates in three moves thus: 9 R - R 4 ch, K - Kt 8; 10 R -  any square on the Rook's file, forcing the Black King in front of the White, K - B 8; 11 R - R 1 mate.

White must now mark time and move one of the Bishops, so as to force the Black King to go back; 10 B - R 5, K - Kt 1; 11 B - K 7, K - R 1. Now the White Bishop must take up a position from which it can give check next move along the White diagonal, when the Black King moves back to Kt 1. 12 B - K Kt 4, K - Kt 1; 13 B - K 6 ch, K - R 1; 14 B - B 6 mate.</p><p>It has taken fourteen moves to force the mate and, in any position, it should be done in under thirty.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In all endings of this kind, care must be taken not to</p>",

As The Queen Combines The Power Of The Rook And The Bishop, It Is The Easiest Mate Of All And Should Always Be Accomplished In Under Ten Moves. Take The Following Position:</h5><p>![Chess position](images/Fig4.jpg \"Chess position\" \"\")</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">A good way to begin is to make the first move with the Queen, trying to limit the Black King's mobility as much as possible. Thus: 1 Q - B 6, K - Q 5; 2 K - Q 2.</p>",
  "page-20": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">Already the Black King has only one available square 2...K - K 4; 3 K - K 3, K - B 4; 4 Q - Q 6, K - Kt 4.

These are the three elementary endings and in all of these the principle is the same. In each case the co-operation of the King is needed. In order to force a mate without the aid of the King, at least two Rooks are required.</p><p>2. PAWN PROMOTION</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The gain of a Pawn is the smallest material advantage that can be obtained in a game; and it often is sufficient to win, even when the Pawn is the only remaining unit, apart from the Kings.

The play would proceed thus: 1 P - K 3, K - K 4; 2 K - Q 3, K - Q 4. This is a very important move. Any other move</p>",
  "page-22": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">would lose, as will be shown later. As the Black King cannot be kept close up to the Pawn, it must be brought as far forward as possible and, at the same time, in front of the White King.</p><p>3 P - K 4 ch, K - K 4; 4 K - K 3, K - K 3; 5 K - B 4, K - B 3. Again the same case. As the White King comes up, the Black King must be kept in front of it, since it cannot be brought up to the Pawn.</p><p>6 P - K 5 ch, K - K 3; 7 K - K 4, K - K 2; 8 K - Q 5, K - Q 2; 9 P - K 6 ch, K - K 2; 10 K - K 5, K - K 1; 11 K - Q 6, K - Q 1. If now White advances the Pawn, the Black King gets in front of it and White must either give up the Pawn or play K - K 6, and a stale mate results. If instead of advancing the Pawn White withdraws his King, Black brings his King up to the Pawn and, when forced to go back, he moves to K <em>in front</em> of the Pawn ready to come up again or to move in front of the White King, as before, should the latter advance.</p>",
  "page-23": "<p>The whole mode of procedure is very important and the student should become thoroughly conversant {11}with its details; for it involves principles to be taken up later on, and because many a beginner has lost identical positions from lack of proper knowledge. At this stage of the book I cannot lay too much stress on its importance.</p><h5>Example 6.—In This Position White Wins, As The King Is In Front Of His Pawn And There Is One Intervening Square.</h5><p>![Chess position](images/Fig6.jpg \"Chess position\" \"\")</p><p>The method to follow is to</p><p><em>advance the King as far as is compatible with the safety of the Pawn and never to advance the Pawn until it is essential to its own safety</em>.</p><p>Thus:</p></ol>",
  "page-24": "<ol><li>K - K 4, K - K 3.</li></ol><p>Black does not allow the White King to advance, therefore White is now compelled to advance his Pawn so as to force Black to move away.

K - Q 5, K - K 2.</li></ol><p>{12}</p><p>If Black had played 3...K - B 4, then White would be forced to advance the Pawn to K 4, since he could not advance his King without leaving Black the opportunity to play K - K 5, winning the Pawn. Since he has not done so, it is better for White not to advance the Pawn yet, since its own safety does not require it, but to try to bring the King still further forward. Thus:</p><ol><li>K - K 5, K - Q 2; 5. K - B 6, K - K 1.</li></ol>",
  "page-25": "<p>Now the White Pawn is too far back and it may be brought up within protection of the King.</p><ol><li>P - K 4, K - Q 2.</li></ol><p>Now it would not do to play K - B 7, because Black would play K - Q 3, and White would have to bring back his King to protect the Pawn.

As Black tries to prevent that, White must now force him to move away, at the same time always keeping the King in front of the Pawn. Thus:</p><ol><li>K - K 6.</li></ol>",
  "page-26": "<p>P - K 6 would make it a draw, as Black would then play K - B, and we would have a position similar to the one explained in connection with Example 5.</p><p>8...K - B 1; 9. K - Q 7.</p><p>{13}</p><p>King moves and the White Pawn advances to K 8, becomes a Queen, and it is all over.</p><p>This ending is like the previous one, and for the same reasons should be thoroughly understood before proceeding any further.</p><p>3. PAWN ENDINGS</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">I shall now give a couple of simple endings of two Pawns against one, or three against two, that the reader may see how they can be won.

  "page-34": "<p>By the time the student has digested all that has been previously explained, he, no doubt, is anxious to get to the actual game and play with all the pieces. However, before considering the openings, we shall devote a little time to some combinations that often arise during the game, and which will give the reader some idea of the beauty of the game, once he becomes better acquainted with it.</p><h5>Example 11.</h5><p>![Chess position](images/Fig11.jpg \"Chess position\" \"\")</p><p>It is Black's move, and thinking that White merely threatens to play Q - R 6 and to mate at K Kt 7, Black plays 1 ... R - K 1, threatening mate by way of R - K 8. White now uncovers his real and most effective threat, viz.:</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">1 ...

  "page-35": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">1; 4 R - R 8 mate. {20}</p><p>This same type of combination may come as the result of a somewhat more complicated position.</p><h5>Example 12.</h5><p>![Chess position](images/Fig12.jpg \"Chess position\" \"\")</p><p>White is a piece behind, and unless he can win it back quickly he will lose; he therefore plays:</p><ol><li>Kt é Kt</li></ol><p>B - Kt 4</p><p>He cannot take the Kt because White threatens mate by Q é P ch followed by R - R 3 ch.</p><ol><li>Kt - K 7 ch</li></ol><p>Q é Kt</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Again if B é Kt; Q é P ch, K é Q; R - R 3 ch, King</p>",

  "page-41": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">more valuable piece in most cases; and it is well known that two Bishops are almost always better than two Knights.</p><p>The Bishop will be stronger against Pawns than the Knight, and in combination with Pawns will also be stronger against the Rook than the Knight will be. {25}</p><p>A Bishop and a Rook are also stronger than a Knight and a Rook, but a Queen and a Knight may be stronger than a Queen and a Bishop.</p><p>A Bishop will often be worth more than three Pawns, but a Knight very seldom so, and may even not be worth so much.</p><p>A Rook will be worth a Knight and two Pawns, or a Bishop and two Pawns, but, as said before, the Bishop will be a better piece against the Rook.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">Two Rooks are slightly stronger than a Queen. They are slightly weaker than two Knights and a Bishop, and a little more so than two Bishops and a Knight. The</p>",
  "page-42": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">power of the Knight decreases as the pieces are changed off. The power of the Rook, on the contrary, increases.</p><p>The King, a purely <em>defensive</em> piece throughout the middle-game, becomes an <em>offensive</em> piece once all the pieces are off the board, and sometimes even when there are one or two minor pieces left. The handling of the King becomes of paramount importance once the end-game stage is reached.</p><p>6. GENERAL STRATEGY OF THE OPENING</p><p>The main thing is to <em>develop the pieces quickly</em>. Get them into play as fast as you can.</p><p>From the outset two moves, 1 P - K 4  or 1 P - Q 4, open up lines for the Queen and a Bishop. Therefore, theoretically one of these two moves must be the best, as no other first move accomplishes so much. {26}</p><h5>Example 17.—Suppose We Begin:</h5><ol><li>P - K 4</li></ol>",
  "page-43": "<p>P - K 4</p><ol><li>Kt - K B 3</li></ol><p>This is both an attacking and a developing move. Black can now either reply with the identical move or play</p><ol><li>........</li></ol><p>Kt - Q B 3</p><p>This developing move at the same time defends the King's Pawn.</p><ol><li>Kt - B 3</li></ol><p>Kt - B 3</p><p>These moves are of a purely developing nature.</p><ol><li>B - Kt 5</li></ol><p class=\" stretch-last-line \"><em>It is generally advisable not to bring this Bishop out</em></p>",
  "page-44": "<p class=\"no-indent  \"><em>until one Knight is out</em>, preferably the King's Knight. The Bishop could also have been played to B 4, but it is advisable whenever possible to combine development and attack.</p><ol><li>........</li></ol><p>B - Kt 5</p><p>Black replies in the same manner, threatening a possible exchange of Bishop for Knight with Kt é P to follow.</p><ol><li>O - O</li></ol><p>an indirect way of preventing 5...B é Kt, which more experience or study will show to be bad. At the same time <em>the Rook is brought into action in the centre, a very important point</em>. {27}</p><ol><li>........</li></ol>",
  "page-45": "<p>O - O</p><p>Black follows the same line of reasoning.</p><ol><li>P - Q 3</li></ol><p>P - Q 3</p><p>These moves have a two-fold object, viz.: to protect the King's Pawn and to open the diagonal for the development of the Queen's Bishop.</p><ol><li>B - Kt 5</li></ol><p>![Chess position](images/Fig17.jpg \"Chess position\" \"\")</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">A very powerful move, which brings us to the middle-game stage, as there is already in view a combination to win quickly by Kt - Q 5. This threat makes it impossible for Black to continue the same course. (There is a long analysis showing that Black should lose if he also plays B - Kt 5. \"He is now forced to</p>",
  "page-46": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">play 7...B é Kt, as experience has shown, thus bringing up to notice three things.\")</p><p>First, the complete development of the opening has taken only seven moves. (This varies up to ten or twelve moves in some very exceptional cases. As a rule, eight should be enough. \"Second, Black has {28}been compelled to exchange a Bishop for a Knight, but as a compensation he has isolated White's Q R P and doubled a Pawn. (This, at such an early stage of the game, is rather an advantage for White, as the Pawn is doubled towards the centre of the board.) Third, White by the exchange brings up a Pawn to control the square Q 4, puts Black on the defensive, as experience will show, and thus keeps <em>the initiative</em>, an unquestionable advantage.- \")</p><p>The strategical principles expounded above are the same for all the openings, only their tactical application varies according to the circumstances.</p>",
  "page-47": "<p>Before proceeding further I wish to lay stress on the following point which the student should bear in mind.</p><p><em>Before development has been completed no piece should be moved more than once, unless it is essential in order to obtain either material advantage or to secure freedom of action.</em></p><p>The beginner would do well to remember this, as well as what has already been stated: viz., <em>bring out the Knights before bringing out the Bishops</em>.</p><p>7. CONTROL OF THE CENTRE</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">The four squares, K 4 and Q 4 on each side respectively, are the centre squares, and control of these squares is called control of the centre. <em>The control of the centre is of great importance.</em> No violent attack can succeed without controlling at least two of these {29}squares, and possibly three. Many a manœuvre in the opening has for its sole object the control of the centre, which invariably ensures the initiative. It is well</p>",
  "page-48": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">always to bear this in mind, since it will often be the reason of a series of moves which could not otherwise be properly understood. As this book progresses I shall dwell more fully on these different points. At present I shall devote some time to openings taken at random and explain the moves according to general principles. The student will in that way train his mind in the proper direction, and will thus have less trouble in finding a way out when confronted with a new and difficult situation.</p><h5>Example 18.</h5><ol><li>P - K 4</li></ol><p>P - K 4</p><ol><li>Kt - K B 3</li></ol><p>P - Q 3</p>",
  "page-49": "<p>A timid move. Black assumes a defensive attitude at once. On principle the move is wrong. In the openings, whenever possible, <em>pieces should be moved in preference to Pawns</em>.</p><ol><li>P - Q 4</li></ol><p>White takes the offensive immediately and strives to control the centre so as to have ample room to deploy his forces.</p><ol><li>........</li></ol><p>Kt - Q 2</p><p>Black does not wish to relinquish the centre and also prefers the text move to Kt - Q B 3, which would be the more natural square for the Kt. But on {30}principle the move is wrong, because it blocks the action of the Queen's Bishop, and instead of facilitating the action of Black's pieces, tends, on the contrary, to cramp them.</p></ol>",
  "page-50": "<ol><li>B - Q B 4</li></ol><p>P - K R 3</p><p>Black is forced to pay the penalty of his previous move. Such a move on Black's part condemns by itself any form of opening that makes it necessary.

  "page-51": "<p>It should be noticed that White does not Castle yet. The reason is that he wants to deploy his forces first, and through the last move force Black to play P - Q B 3 to make room for the Queen as White threatens R - Q 1, to be followed by P é P. Black's other alternatives would finally force him to play P é P, thus abandoning the centre to White.</p><ol><li>........</li></ol><p>P - B 3</p><ol><li>R - Q 1</li></ol><p>Q - B 2</p><ol><li>O - O</li></ol><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">With this last move White completes his development, while Black is evidently somewhat hampered.

  "page-52": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">that White's position {31}is unassailable. There are no weak spots in his armour, and his pieces are ready for any manœuvre that he may wish to carry out in order to begin the attack on the enemy's position. The student should carefully study this example. It will show him that it is sometimes convenient to delay Castling. I have given the moves as they come to my mind without following any standard book on openings. Whether the moves given by me agree or not with the standard works, I do not know, but at the present stage of this book it is not convenient to enter into discussions of mere technicalities which the student will be able to understand when he has become more proficient.</p><h5>Example 19.</h5><ol><li>P - K 4</li></ol><p>P - K 4</p></ol>",

Nor does B - R 5 help matters, because of 2 Q é B, 1... B - K 3 leaves Black with the inferior position. But White's move in the text secures an immediate material advantage, and the beginner at any rate should never miss such an opportunity for the sake of a speculative advantage in position.</p><ol><li>........</li></ol><p>K é B</p><ol><li>Kt - K 5 ch</li></ol><p>K moves</p></ol>",

A CARDINAL PRINCIPLE</p><p>![Chess position](images/Fig21.jpg \"Chess position\" \"\")</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">In the position shown above, White can draw by playing P - Kt 4 according to the general rule that</p>",
  "page-60": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">governs such cases, i.e. <em>to advance the Pawn that is free from opposition</em>.

Then Black can win by playing 1... P - Q R 4, applying one of the cardinal principles of the high strategy of chess—</p><p><em>A unit that holds two.</em></p><p>In this case one Pawn would hold two of the opponent's Pawns. The student cannot lay too much stress on this principle. It can be applied in many ways, and it constitutes one of the principal weapons in the hands of a master.</p><h5>Example 22.—The Example Given Should Be Sufficient Proof.

OBTAINING A PASSED PAWN</p><p>When three or more Pawns are opposed to each other in some such position as the one in Example 24, there is always a chance for one side or the other of obtaining a passed Pawn.</p><p class=\" stretch-last-line \">![Chess position](images/Fig25.jpg \"Chess position\"</p>",

HOW TO FIND OUT WHICH PAWN WILL BE FIRST TO QUEEN</p><p>When two Pawns are free, or will be free, to advance to Queen, you can find out, by counting, which Pawn will be the first to succeed.</p><h5>Example 25.—In This Position Whoever Moves First Wins.</h5>",

When, as in this case, it cannot be done, the point is to count which Pawn comes in first. In this case the time is the same, but the Pawn that reaches the eighth square first and becomes a Queen is in a position to capture the adversary's Queen when he makes one. Thus:</p><ol><li>P - R 4</li></ol><p>P - K R 4</p><ol><li>P - R 5</li></ol><p>P - R 5</p></ol>",

  "page-72": "<p class=\"no-indent  \">when he can or cannot get there first. Once again I must call attention to the fact that a book cannot by itself teach how to play.

THE OPPOSITION</p><p>When Kings have to be moved, and one player can, by force, bring his King into a position similar to the one shown in the following diagram, so that his adversary is forced to move and make way for him, the player obtaining that advantage is said to have <em>the opposition</em>.</p><p>![Chess position](images/Fig27.jpg \"Chess position\" \"\")</p><h5>Example 26.—Suppose In The Above Position White Plays</h5><ol><li>K - Q 4</li></ol>",

White, according to the principles already laid down, develops his pieces as fast as possible, but in so doing he also tries to hinder his opponent's development, by applying pressure wherever possible. He tries first of all to control the centre, and failing this to obtain some positional advantage that will make it possible for him to keep on harassing the enemy. He only relinquishes the initiative when he gets for it some material advantage under such favourable conditions as to make him feel {78}assured that he will, in turn, be able to withstand his adversary's thrust; and finally, through his superiority of material, once more resume the initiative, which alone can give him the victory.

It is always an advantage to threaten something, but such threats must be carried into effect only if something is to be gained immediately. For, holding the threat in hand, forces the opponent to provide against its execution and to keep material in readiness to meet it.
